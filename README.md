## Labs
A list of institutions and their magnetics (and related) laboratories.

### [Oregon State University - College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/)<a id="osu-ceoas"></a>

- [Paleomagnetic & Environment Magnetic Research Laboratory (OSU P-Mag Lab)](http://paleomag.coas.oregonstate.edu)  
  PI: **Joe Stoner**  
  *The P-Mag Lab is an NSF supported OSU facility dedicated to sediment magnetism and a resource for Pacific NW, national and international scientific communities.*

  Instruments:
  - **2G Enterprises 3-axis Superconducting Rock Magnetometer (SRM)** 
    Optimized for u-channel samples, equipped with high resolution DC squids, a software controlled tracking system, in-line alternating field demagnetization coils, in-line DC coil for acquisition of an anhysteric remanent magnetization and a seperate off-line pulse magnetizer for acquisition of an isothermal remanent magnetization for u-channel samples up to fields of 1 Tesla
  - **Bartington MS3 Susceptibility Meter**  
    With a 10cm diameter MS2C loop sensor equipped with core track for field measurements and an MS2B for measurement of dual frequency magnetic susceptibility on discrete samples
  - **ASC Model IM-10-30 Impulse Magnetizer**  
    Capable of producing DC field up to 1.2 Tesla

- [OSU Argon Geochronology Lab (OSU-AGL)](http://geochronology.coas.oregonstate.edu)  
  PI: **Anthony Koppers**  
  *In our OSU Argon Geochronology Lab we employ the <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar geochronology method to determine how hotspots evolve and interact with lithosphere, in quantifying rates at which large igneous provinces are constructed, in deciphering the early history of the Earth and Moon, in tracking transport pathways of terrigenous sediments from rivers to deep-sea sediments, and more.*   

  Instruments:
  - 2 **Thermo Scientific ARGUS VI**  
    Multi-collector mass spectrometers, each with five fixed Faraday detectors (including amplifier circuits with 10<sup>12</sup> Ohm resistors) and one ion-counting CuBe electron multiplier mounted next to the low mass 36 Faraday detector
  - **25 W Synrad CO2 Lasers**  
    With industrial scan head for carrying out gas extractions
