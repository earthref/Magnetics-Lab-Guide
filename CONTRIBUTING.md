## Styling

- Keep lists in alphabetical order.
- When adding/updating a lab with a list of their instruments, also update the instruments section, and vice versa.
- To add a line break, end the line with two spaces.
- If your contribution is a translation, add a (relative) link to the README above the [Table of Contents](README.md#table-of-contents).
